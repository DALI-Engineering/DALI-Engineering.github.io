## About Me

I am a Dartmouth PhD Student interested in engineering, design, and building physical products.  
I enjoy working on hands-on projects and learning how ideas turn into real, usable objects.

This website documents my work for the **DALI Hardware Engineering Mini-Series: Product Design & Development**, where we are collaboratively designing and building a functional desk lamp.
