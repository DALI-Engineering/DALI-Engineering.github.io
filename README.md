# DALI Hardware Engineering Mini-Series  
## Product Design & Development

**Winter 2026**  
Dartmouth Applied Learning and Innovation Lab (DALI)

This mini-series is an accelerated, hands-on introduction to **hardware product design and development**.  
Over nine weeks, students will work through the full product journey and collaboratively design and build a **functional desk lamp**.

This website serves as the **central reference** for the course, including weekly content, expectations, and example documentation.

## What You Will Learn

- How real products are designed from idea to physical object  
- How to define users, requirements, and constraints  
- How to ideate, prototype, and iterate  
- How to document engineering work clearly and professionally
- How to use digital fabrication tools such as: 3D printers, Laser Cutters, Vinyl Cutters, CNC mills

This course emphasizes **process over perfection**.
