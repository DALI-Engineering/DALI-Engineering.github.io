## Grading

There is no grading per se... This mini-series is **low-pressure and participation-focused**. However, to successfully complete this mini-series you are expected to follow along with the in-person classes and also complete the assignments. It is important that you complete the assignments since each week builds on each other, and your assignment will be building towards the final product: the lamp.

Effort and engagement matter more than technical perfection.
